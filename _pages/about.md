Iâ€™m a Yongjiang Youth Independent Fellow at EIT in Ningbo, China. My research is in the application of control and dynamical systems theory to systems and synthetic biology. I focus on developing theory foundations and design principles of biomolecular control circuits in living cells and multicellular communities. A core foundamental question I am interested in is realizing stable and robust functionality and performance in engineered biological systems, in the applications of bioproduction, biosensing, biocomputation, biomedicine, and etc.


I approach this goal both from the engineering angle, by developing new theoretical frameworks and molecular implementations for genetic circuit design, and from the scientific angle, by studying fundamental questions about gene regulation and microbial physiology in variable environments. Please see the Research page for more details.

model-based analysis, design, and implementation of biomolecular control circuits in living cells and multicellular communities. My goal  


to synthetic biology advances in the laboratory into the deployment environment, with a particular focus on applications related to sustainability.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
