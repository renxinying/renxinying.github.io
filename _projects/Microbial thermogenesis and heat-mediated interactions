Catabolism yields ATP and intrinsically generates metabolic heat. A cell uses ATP to drive cellular mainte-
nance and growth. For years it was assumed that bacteria utilizes ATP efficiently, meaning biomass production
in growth is efficient from standard biosynthesis. However, observed biomass production is 3-to-10 fold or more
lower than predicted.Why do bacteria spill energy and deliberately dissipate ATP? To understand the varying
growth efficiency, we need to measure and calculate ATP generation, biomass production and heat generation
accurately. Therefore, we utilize genetic engineering techniques that induce high heat production in E.coli and measure heat production via high resolution temperature-sensitive nanoprobes.

Heat is not just a byproduct from catabolism. Metabolic heat can alter local temperature, and microbes differ on their optimal survival and growth temperature.
A microbe that raises the
local temperature closer to its own optimum gains a growth advantage over other competitors.
Several examples in natural microbes suggest excess heat is a public good that benefits neighbors. Some
organisms increase dark pigment to raise cellular temperature. Some other microbes contribute heat by excess
thermogenesis and spend ATP on heat production. Groups or populations can retain heat by aggregation and
by insulation, for example, forming biofilms.

A new concept ”thermal signaling”, in which temperature variation within biological cells acts as a signal
in a cascade of intriguing biological events, arises as an interesting topic for us. Questions are: 1. within the population, how are they cooperate since heat generators pay the
cost of production and others exploit the public heat (heterogeneity)? 2. How to use heat as a competitive
weapon, maybe also defend against invading bacteria?
