The spatial-temporal evolution of interspecies interactions in multicellular communities plays an important role for them to survive, adapt and perform functions in certain environments.
On the one hand, interspecies interactions facilitate self-organized spatial structures. For example, cell populations grow or actively migrate towards nutrients through cross-feeding interactions.
Interspecies killing also restructures a community via contact-based inhibition or diffusible toxins.
On the other hand, the efficiency of interspecies interactions is strongly impacted by the physical location and distance of cells in defined spatial environments.
Thererfore, the interspecies interactions and spatial environments co-evolve to maintain long-term stability.

We are particularly interested in why certain spatial structures in multicellular communities provide benefits for cells to survive changing environments and how cell populations self-organize into such spatial structures.
By investigating the mechanisms of the spatial-temportal evolution of interspecies interactions, we are able to engineer synthetic circuits that perform diverse interactions and achieve stable coexistence and robustness to environmental disturbances.
