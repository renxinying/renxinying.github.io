In synthetic biology, we hope to generate tunable and characterized biological modules, and design and implement biological circuits by rewiring these modules to achieve novel functions in living organisms. 
These functions often depend on stable, robust and controllable gene expression, metabolism, and intercellular interactions, therefore cells can function as reliable 'living machines' in a group or community without catastrophic failures.
To engineer biological circuits that realize stable and robust population level behaviors, we apply feedback control mechanism as a theory foundation and investigate multiscale design principles from single-cell level to popualtion level.

We consider each single cell as a dynamical system with its own input/output dynamics of gene expression and metabolism.
